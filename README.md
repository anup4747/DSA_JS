# DSA_JS

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of classic data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. It is intended as a reference and practice resource for programmers looking to learn, revise, or master DSA concepts in JS.

## Features

- Common data structures (such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Popular algorithms (sorting, searching, traversal, etc.)
- Clear and readable code with comments
- Suitable for beginners and intermediate learners

## Getting Started

No installation is required. Simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anup4747/DSA_JS.git
```

You can run and test the code using Node.js or any JavaScript runtime.

## Folder Structure

Organized by topic, each file typically contains one data structure or algorithm demonstration. Browse the code to explore different implementations.

## Usage

Open any `.js` file in the repo to view and run the implementation. Example usage may be included as comments within each file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests for improvements, bug fixes, or new implementations.
